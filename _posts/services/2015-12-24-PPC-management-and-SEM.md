Paid search is perhaps the fastest, most targeted and most effective marketing channel of all time. Keyword-triggered cost-per-click search engine marketing ("paid search") is pure genius and represents a huge opportunity no matter your industry, products, or service offering.

Our approach to paid search focuses on continuous testing and improvement where our goals are to:

<ol>
  <li style="font-weight: 700">Continually <u>increase</u> the volume of quality leads generated.</li>
  <li style="font-weight: 700">Continually <u>reduce</u> your overall cost-per-lead.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>It has been said that SEM takes an hour to learn, and lifetime to master.</p></blockquote>

A lot of businesses make uneducated attempts at running programs like Google AdWords. They quickly blow their budget and then they say that it doesn't work because of [insert excuse here], and that they are going to focus on SEO instead, because SEO is "free."

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We see this pattern and what it says to us is that you're refusing to admit that your company is getting pushed out of the marketplace.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We can see your competitors' exact keywords that they are spending on month after month. Barring some type of vanity motivation, do you think that multiple companies would continue their spend on the same keywords over time if it wasn't ROI-ing for them?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are truly interested in increasing your sales, the prospects are there — and even if there are a lot people fishing in the same hole — we are going to go to market with landing pages that are superior to those of your competitors, and we are going to <mark>test and tweak until we hit your target goals.</mark>
